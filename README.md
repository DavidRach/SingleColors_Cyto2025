This repository is for our '“Well, how bright does it need to be?”: Investigating the interplay of fluorescent signature and brightness in single-color unmixing controls' poster. It contains the data and R code needed to hopefully reproduce our analysis and figures, as well as the .svg files used to create the figures in Inkscape.

## Organization

The .csv files for the respective analyses are stored in the data folder, from which they can be accessed by the code. The code is contained within the Quarto Markdown (.qmd) files named after the respective figure. The .svg files can be opened with Inkscape to access the Figure assembly layout. 

## Luciernaga

Please note, you will need to install [Luciernaga](https://github.com/DavidRach/Luciernaga) to reproduce some of the Figures. The package version utilized for running of the code in this manuscript was the 0.99.4 release. 

## Raw Data

Due to size constraints, this repository only contains the processed data files derrived from our original .fcs files. The actual .fcs files are being uploaded to ImmPort (SDY3080) and will be available at the next release cycle.
